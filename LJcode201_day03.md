Lecture was great, but the lab was a little challenging.
Learned a lot about using for and while looping along with a little bit of math.
Also took a quiz which I took me a while the first time, but the second try was
of course much easier. It definitely was great review of what was already learned in class
although I don't believe we didn't talk about git branching so that was a tricky
question, because I felt like I missed something in class.

Overall, a good and successful day. I know more today than I did yesterday, and
I am surprisingly looking forward to tomorrow. :-)
