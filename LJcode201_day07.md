Today's lecture was better to me because it was more hands on with the code
review and also the review for the lab. Going into the lab, after looking at the
code review I have a lot to perfect and change. So I will spend  1/4 of the lab
doing so, and the rest of lab working on what is due today. I'm starting to
understand, I still refuse to be overwhelmed and I am going to conquer and grasp
this before this class is over.
