Lab today was really intense. The attention to detail was crazy, which is good
because it constantly keep you on your toes about your code.
Learning about functions wasn't bad though, and doing the test really allowed me
learn about the console so much more than anything this week.
Going to use all day Saturday to go over everything we went over this week to
get a better grasp and understanding about everything, also work a little more
on my about_me page to make it look more appealing. Turn everything in, and then
take Sunday off to recuperate, gather my thoughts and gear up for Monday morning.
