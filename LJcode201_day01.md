Great first day again in code 201. It was interesting to learn about javascript again.
I felt better than I did a month ago, especially after doing the pre-work. It really helped alot.
Looking forward to the rest of the week and I am excited about all the chaos that is to come.
BRING ON THE PAIN! Haha
