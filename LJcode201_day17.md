Today was okay. We got stuck on the javascript part a little. Trying to figure
out the functionality part of it which we knew that it was going to be a little
difficult. It's more about the placement of the picture now. We played around
with it on HTML and as a example of what it's suppose to look like. So we'll get
done tomorrow, we split up some of the work to get more leverage and waste
less time on Wednesday.
