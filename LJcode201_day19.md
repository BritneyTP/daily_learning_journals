Today was a little hectic. Fiona and I were working on CSS cleaning up code.
A lot of tweaking. Britt finished up the javascript.
Feeling a little useless because Britt took on most of the javascript and is
doing a lot 301 jquery which is completely over my head 😩
But it's a learning experience, being in a group and splitting up work, having
people stronger in different areas. Anywho, I'm talking out the side of my neck
right now, not really making any sense.
Hopefully tomorrow goes smoothly. 😊👍🏾
