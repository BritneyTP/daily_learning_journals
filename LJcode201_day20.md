This is the last day of 201 and it's bitter sweet. I loved the class,
my classmates, instructors, TA's, everybody. They will always have a place in
my heart. I started 201 in June during that class, didn't have a chance to do
pre-work, came back and I realized that it wasn't necessarily the pre-work
itself, but the environment I was in. Not saying it was that bad, but the class
that I am associated with now was more understanding about my background and
how coding was completely something new that I had no idea about. A sense of
community and just family was simply amazing.
The first week was a little refresher since I see the code somewhat before.
Week two was a complete turn of events, learning the structure of javascript and
all the components there (which I am so glad I'm auditing and taking a break)
was a little overwhelming. It go to the point where I was truly counting down
the day. But more so made me realize how hard it is learning new material. It's
never easy but it's always worth it in the long run.
So when week three came around it was much more of a me taking a deep breath
and really absorbing exactly what I learned and what the weeks before and
applying to where we were then.
Going into project week I felt okay and reassured that there are definitely
going to be problems and certain situation where I am going to be placed in
groups that have to work together and initially figuring out what everyones
strengths and weaknesses are really helps, with delegating the work and applying
and putting it all together. I am excited for what it to come. I am excited to
present, but most importantly that I've built great and wonderful relationships
with wonderful people that I will cherish for a lifetime! ðŸ’œ
