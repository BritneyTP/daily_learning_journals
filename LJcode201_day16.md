Today was a very good day. I am working Britt and Fiona. We exectued the work
load last week before friday was over and Britt had the brilliant idea to pair
program which was great and helped alot because while one was driving, the others
could see mistakes and make changes accordingly. We avoided alot of problems
by doing this as well. One thing that we stressed is the fact that we are a in
this together, and We are one. Which is how we came up with our group name.
W-R-O .... Because we WRO-ll together. haha
I know that's corny. Anywho, we met our goals for today and we have a set of
goals for tomorrow and wednesday so I'm excited to see how far we get.

Go team WRO!!! ðŸ˜Š
