Remembering all the steps to GIT is going to be difficult but by making us do
the learning journal everyday for the next month it will definitely help.
Although it is proving to be a pain, I am LOVING CSS and the design aspect.
 -- In my former life I'd like to think that I was an actress, model, and designer.
 All in all, the second day is going way better than a month ago, the pre-work
 really helped with that.
 --It hasn't gotten to stressful yet (my fingers are crossed) and I'm optimistic.

 Looking forward to tomorrow! :-)
