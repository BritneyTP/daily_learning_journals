Today was a very good day. So glad that we do code review at the beginning of
the class. It really helps a lot, especially seeing how everyone else did they're
code and learning how to scope and figure out the problems which in the end helps
us understand and grasp the concept. (I don't know if that made any sense haha)

All in all, today was very productive, and low-key in the sense of learning how
to pair program, becoming a master at git and processing different codes,
while not being overwhelmed like yesterday's lab, and having a chance to just
gathering our thoughts. I feel good about everything. Going to play around with
some CSS tonight to get my page looking a little better, because I have a strong
feeling my about_me will be used tomorrow. FINGERS CROSSED! haha
