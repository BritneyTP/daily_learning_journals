Today was a little easier thanks to Munir for explaining everything, allowing us
to fully grasp the concepts and be able to go through the steps to an effective
code. I was a little behind getting everything put together but I'm glad that
I got everything up and running. CSS is fun because it always me to be free. I'm
more of a designer than a programer, but after I put everything together I will
be both!
Thanks Munir! ðŸ˜Š
