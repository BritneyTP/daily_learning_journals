Today was a good day. Had a chance to learn a little bit about 301. Watched 301 presentations which was awesome. They did an outstanding job, and lastly worked
on the group project. My team is Team War. We don't quite have an actual team
name for sure but it's in the works. I feel really good about our project and
excited to put it together and present. ðŸ˜Š
