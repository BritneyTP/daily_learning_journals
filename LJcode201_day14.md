Today's lab was very good. I liked how low key it was. Giving us a chance to
work through some conflicts and certain things in order for us to be prepared
and ready for next week when we are in our groups!
S/o to whoever put the groups together. I have an awesome team and I am looking
forward to working with both Britt and FIFI.
We have to come up with names from each other since there are two Britney's in
Group: WAR!
So Britt will stay the same, I am going to be called by my middle name Tian or
just T, and Fiona is FIFI! ðŸ˜Š
