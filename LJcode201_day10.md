Thank you Jesus! Today was a breath of fresh air. Loved working with my partner
Judy, she has great work ethic and was a great motivator during the pair
programming project. Although we didn't get through the whole thing I'm glad I
had her to go through the experience with.

Now I get a chance to catch up on some CSS and work over the weekend with my
cookie_stand page. #Blessed
